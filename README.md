MultiPageDisplay
================

A work in progress to create a modern tab pane in JavaFX.
This tab pane is created to be similar to modern browser and IDE
page/document views.
Codewise this project's goal is to avoid all private sun.* &
com.sun.* packages and usages of reflection to build a tab pane.

To test out run the MultiPageDisplayDemo class once project is checked
out & built.
